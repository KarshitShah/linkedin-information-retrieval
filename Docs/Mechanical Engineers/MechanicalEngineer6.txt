My pioneering ability on problem statements has assisted me to design and analyze an innovative material testing equipment undertaken as my Master's project.  A belief and desire to practice lean manufacturing techniques has helped me contribute positively in improving several processes at IFB Industries Ltd during my tenure of 3 years. Highly inspired by the 14 Principles of Toyota Production System, creating continuous flow surfaced the problems and solving them increased the production numbers tremendously. I believe that Lean manufacturing and Automation go hand in hand to achieve a higher efficiency of an assembly line and also saves the capital investment.  My goal is to implement the innovative ideas and utilize my experience of product design and lean manufacturing techniques with advanced automation for the growth and profit of the organization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Veoneer","Mechanical Engineer - NPPI","Jan 2020","PRESENT","","Markham, Ontario","https://www.linkedin.com/company/veoneer","veoneer",,,"IFB Industries Ltd","Manufacturing Process Engineer","Jul 2015","Jul 2018","• New Product Development: Introduced new products for mass production by designing process layout on AutoCAD, participating in design reviews with R & D for Design for Manufacturing, Validated the process for Pilot Production to achieve First-Time-Right, saving rework cost. • Design / Process Analysis and tools: Reviewed DFMEA and Developed PFMEA, control plans, standard operating procedures, Poke-Yoke, leaded engineering change management activities (ECNs). • Kaizen - Process improvement: Support in-house high-volume manufacturing operations (i.e. automated stamping and injection molding) KPI improvement through continuous improvement by applying TPS methods, lead cross-functional problem-solving activities related to process design using 5-why and 8D techniques. • Designed in SolidWORKS and implemented jigs and fixtures to reduce material handling waste. • Automation Projects: Greasing system to precisely dispense grease on bearing seal, implemented high torque multi-spindle screw driving gun, implemented high speed plastic spin welding machine, validated processes and implemented auto-testing of machine and auto-loading of machine cabinets on moving fixtures. • Project Management: Conducted research for machine feasibility and cost effectiveness from selecting a machine, evaluating tenders and ordering the machine to increase productivity and process capability. • Line Balancing: Balanced the Semi-automated assembly line at a target cycle of 9 seconds from 18 seconds using time-motion analysis and work measurement studies on AVIX software and eliminating Non value added activities.
