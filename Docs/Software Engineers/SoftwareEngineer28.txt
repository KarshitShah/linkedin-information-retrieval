I am a recent MS graduate from CMU's Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, with 1 year of full-time and 1+ years of net internship experience at various organizations like Google and Morgan Stanley.   My coursework and projects at CMU primarily revolve around Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and some amount of Multimodal ML. My MS capstone project is titled ‘Hinglish Code-Mixed AI Conversational Agents’ advised by Prof. Alan Black.  While at Carnegie Mellon, I've been a TA for graduate-level course offerings of Intro to Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing.  My attached resume has more details. Happy to connect and engage further.","shaleenx",,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://shaleenkumargupta.com","https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/","https://shaleenx.wordpress.com/","Google","Software Engineer - II","Mar 2020","PRESENT","Using Deep Learning to improve Google Search Ranking for Semi Structured Data","Mountain View, California, United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/google","google",,,"Carnegie Mellon University","Graduate Teaching Assistant","Sep 2019","Dec 2019","Introduction to Artifical Intelligence.
