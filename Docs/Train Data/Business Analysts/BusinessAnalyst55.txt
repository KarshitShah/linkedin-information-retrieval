I believe in the following quote - ""DATA is the MOST POWERFUL asset in this WORLD and EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS of DATA can do WONDERS""  As a Data Analyst Intern, I have been currently working with sensitive student learning outcome of my school and performing qualitative and quantitative analysis to get any underlying patterns and trends in the data. It has helped me to understand how an organization can benefit from an efficient analysis of the data it has.  Some of my job functions include - - Preparing the standard operating procedures (SOP's) and policies for data governance in the department.  - Detailed reporting of the steps of the analysis to ensure reproducibility. - Mentoring and assisting five undergraduate interns in having a smooth transition after I depart.  By working as a Data Analyst at an SAP consulting company, I got to experience the client-facing part of the job. I loved working with different clients, managing deadlines and handling the pressure.  - My primary job function was to work with SQL to analyze the client's data and use it for reporting purposes.  - As it was a small company, I got a chance to handle multiple roles and learn about ERP systems (SAP B1).  - Some of the other functions which I managed or assisted in were project management, implementing ERP systems (SAP B1) and software development.  As a current student in Information Systems at Robert H. Smith School of Business, I have been acquiring the skills which will help me to excel in my career as a Data Analyst. Doing academic projects and learning about the current tools used in the data industry has given me a hands-on learning experience before stepping into the corporate world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ZS","Business Technology Analyst","Feb 2020","PRESENT","","Princeton","https://www.linkedin.com/company/zs-associates","zs-associates",,,"University of Maryland - Robert H.
