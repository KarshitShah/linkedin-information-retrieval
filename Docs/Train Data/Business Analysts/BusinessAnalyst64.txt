I was that kid who was outdoorsy, social, a good listener, empathizer and comes up with solutions. As you can imagine, it drove my parents crazy. Even though it was a hassle for my family, this trait worked very well in my career. Months before graduating my bachelor's I was recruited as an IT Business Analyst and paid to talk to people, build connections, solve their problems and it was like living the dream. The job also made me realize that I can help companies increase their Return on Investment, effectively collaborate with stakeholders saving cost and time needed to rework the project, implement cost-effective solutions, and successfully deliver projects achieving the company's objectives. I loved my job as I was able to leverage my passion on a professional level. I realized I could do better, and so I went on to pursue my Master's.  What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. At the heart of it, I am happiest when I am engaging with people, learning what motivates them, and then strategizing about how we can help one another. My superpower is establishing more meaningful connections and I have gotten strong feedback in the past about the same. My clients have remarked that I was one of the best Business Analyst's they have worked with. These sorts of connections fuel my drive to achieve more than my monthly/quarterly targets and outperform my peers.
