SMART devices plays an important aspects in everyone's life, aiding navigations and other problems in both urban and no urban environment.Therefore,we have come up with one such Smart devices called ‘TechLet’. The main objective of the project is to provide a user a hassle free, daily usable, simple, smart wallet with bit of modifications compare to general wallet and addition of more features.This wallet consist of GPS module, NumPad locking system interfaced with controller for tracking and having a safety features from theft and robbery.With the use of Skylab simulator we can get the position of the wallet, where it is at present and the wallet has the unique code(default password), which helps to unlock the wallet whenever the user want to open the wallet, which makes it very secure.","K.J.
