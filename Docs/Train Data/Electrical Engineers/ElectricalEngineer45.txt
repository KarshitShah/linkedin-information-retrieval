I was associated with Tata Consultancy Services as Assistant System Engineer for 1.7 years. During this period, I responsibly analyze the impact of updates on existing British telecommunication network and provide the optimum solution for corresponding system changes.  I started my master’s degree in Fall 2017. During my masters, I worked on several projects in which I developed a model-based control system for AC-DC machines, vehicle dynamics, power converters, powertrain control for HEV, automotive controls etc. Considering the importance of communication, I explored the in-vehicle communication networks such as CAN. These academic experiences landed me with great opportunity to work as a control engineer intern with The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). I designed vehicle supervisory controller in MIL for the Hybrid electrical two-wheeler. Now, I want to step forward in my carrier path hence with this background I am actively looking for co-op opportunity starting from Jan 2019 or full-time position starting from June 2019. If I can add value to your team, please contact me.
