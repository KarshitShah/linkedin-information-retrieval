My undergrad was spent exploring various fields in the Analog Electronics domain and shifted my focus to digital electronics and Embedded systems during my graduate school.  Skilled in Python, Verilog, and Eagle CAD;  I have done a myriad of projects in each of them which I feel have given me a strong foundation in my coding and designing skills. I had the opportunity to work on the cutting edge technology at Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India, where I contributed in designing a cooling system for a gas detection system to be incorporated in the plant design, and at Iko Systems, New York, where I was in charge of developing the existing product as per customer feedback and optimizing circuitry to reduce noise and adding additional functionalities.  Apart from this, I also have a knack for Public Relations and Marketing with a demonstrated history of working in various committees and clubs like the Entrepreneurship Cell and Rotaract Club of King's Circle, Matunga and my undergrad's annual Socio-cultural festival 'Trinity'.
