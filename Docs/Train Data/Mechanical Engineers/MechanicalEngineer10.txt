I graduated with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in December 2018. I was granted a fellowship at the new makerspace on campus, as part of which I worked as full-time staff till May 2019.  I worked on maintaining, testing, playing around with all the machines we had at the space and helped students fabricate their prototypes using the most appropriate prototyping process. I also taught a course called 'Intro to Modern Making' wherein I taught rapid prototyping tools and techniques to students from different backgrounds, Arduino training and we ended the course with a mini project.  I have experience designing electromechanical systems. I have worked with composites, plastics, foams, metals, fixtures and gauges. I built my own low-cost injection molding machine. I have also worked with a number of sensors and actuators interfacing with Arduino.  I have worked on projects handling responsibilities ranging from ideation -> designing - engineering - prototyping - testing - manufacturing - mass production process. I particularly enjoy converting problem statements into engineered solutions.   Hands-on Experience: Additive Manufacturing (FDM, SLA, design for additive), Metal Fabrication (lathes, knee mills, power tools, CNC machining), product development and testing, electromechanical assemblies (arduino, raspberry pi, PCB design and fabrication).  I have spent a number of hours at the makerspace and have a good understanding of designing for manufacturability. I design my initial prototypes (proof of concepts) while simultaneously thinking of fabrication processes instead of doing them one after the other. The hands-on machining experience has helped me become a more efficient designer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.nikthemechanic.com",,,"Stealth Mode Autonomous Driving Startup","Mechanical Engineer","Feb 2020","PRESENT","","San Jose, California","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Stealth%20Mode%20Autonomous%20Driving%20Startup",,,,"JUMPWatts","Mechanical Engineering Intern","Dec 2019","Jan 2020","Joined in at an extremely early stage of the startup and was responsible for converting the ideas generated during business meetings into proof-of-concept prototypes. I also worked on streamlining the mechanical design process at the startup and develop the early prototypes into a manufacturable assembly after getting feedback from the users. This was a great learning experience from an entrepreneurial point of view and I learned a lot from Arun and Bryan about what it takes to start your own company. see less","Los Angeles","https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumpwatts","jumpwatts",,,"Motivo Engineering","Mechanical Engineering Intern","Aug 2019","Oct 2019","Jumped into a fast-paced project to help with the extra workload the team faced.
