The project involved study of existing models, their mechanisms, finding viable changes and accordingly design and analyze the components. We also performed market survey for the brought outs used and undertook cost analysis for the prototype. Through this project I got acquainted with the concept of interdisciplinary approach in designing a product. Individually I also studied and plotted the effect of change in lateral and longitudinal dimensional parameters and geometry of condenser on heat transfer coefficient. see less","Pune Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-chemical-laboratory","national-chemical-laboratory",,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay","Summer Research Intern","May 2015","Jul 2015","Worked as a Research Intern (Summer 2015) at Cryogenics Laboratory, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, under Prof. Dr. Milind Atrey. Internship demanded MATLAB GUI coding to produce the phasor diagram of orifice type and double inlet valve type PTC and determination of phasor angle. I also worked on the modeling of isothermal analysis and its correlation with the phasor analysis. I verified the results from the research paper titled, “Isothermal model of Pulse tube refrigerator” S. W. Zhu, Z. Q. Chen, Cryogenics, Volume 34, Issue-7, Pages 591-595, 1993. Values of mass flow rate at cold end and refrigeration power found from phasor analysis matched closely with the results of isothermal analysis with an average error of 9.11% and 32.8% respectively. I observed the difference in the results due to different sets of assumptions in two methods of analysis. During my time at IIT-B, I realized the significance of and even got to learn mathematical modeling. I am now well versed in coding for Graphical User Interface in MATLAB. see less","Bombay, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-institute-of-technology-bombay","indian-institute-of-technology-bombay",,,"University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","Master's degree","Mechanical Engineering","3.875","2016","2018","","University of Pune","Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)","Mechanical Engineering","76%","2012","2016","Scored distinction throughout 8 semesters and have been one among the toppers.
