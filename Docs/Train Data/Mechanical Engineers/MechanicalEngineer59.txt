My interests towards arts and technology made me choose mechanical engineering, and my fascination towards the human brain and thought process made me take psychology as minor.          My diverse set of experiences growing up will contribute to the general community. Being educated in a boarding school taught me discipline and self-sufficiency. My community service experiences earned me two Duke of Edinburgh awards. After coming to the US, I kept an open mind and immersed myself into the hackathon culture. I have worked on projects involving insurance policy changes for autism, interactive clothing fabrics to communicate with mobile devices and won the Angel Hacks - Boston 2016 by pioneering a way for map directions and travel advice without internet access.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://sgowthamrdd.wixsite.com/website",,,"Precisionary Instruments","Mechanical Engineer","Jan 2018","Jun 2018","• Designed 3D models of parts and systems using Solidworks to test new features to be introduced into the new and existing product line (Compresstome) • Machined parts using drilling, milling machines and band saw as per design specifications to manufacture parts for product modifications • Used Arduino circuit and programming to test longevity of new functions introduced in the product • Documented procedures and processes to manufacture parts for standardized product design","Greater Boston Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/precisionary-instruments","precisionary-instruments",,,"Amramp","Assistant Engineer","Jan 2017","Jun 2017","• Designed 3D models of parts and products (Wheel chair ramps) using Solidworks for manufacturing under the guidelines of Massachusetts & International building code • Updated & customized existing parts and product designs for specific clients • Created a new Bill of Materials system to identify Solidworks drawings of parts and assembly designs easily for the team • Created novel designs of parts (ramp sections, platforms, legs, pickets, & brackets) for new product line along with the Instructional & Architectural packages with GD&T for the product approval by the City Engineer • Tested for weight tolerances to incorporate and introduce cost effective designs see less","Greater Boston Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/amramp","amramp",,,"RRR Transport","Technical Support Engineer","May 2014","Aug 2014","• Reconstructed analog registry and client information to digital to provide mobile and safe accessibility of client and project information for the regional teams • Assisted developing technically adroit teams for regional expansion • System hardware and software maintenance","Vellore, India","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=RRR%20Transport",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Northeastern University","Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)","Mechanical Engineering with Psychology Minor","","2014","2019","","Sarala Birla Academy","Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (I.C.S.E) and Indian School Certificate (I.S.C)","High School/Secondary Diplomas and Certificates","","2007","2014","",,,,,,,,"""Manufacturing : 1, SolidWorks : 11, Research and Development (R&D) : 1, Photography : 7, Event Management : 3, Social Media : 5, Visual Arts : 4, Mechanical Engineering : 3, Entrepreneurship : 1, Psychology : 0, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) : 0, Medical Devices : 0, Environmental Science : 0, Event Planning : 0, Research : 0, 3D Printing : 0, Social Networking : 7, Machining : 0, Java : 7, AutoCAD : 11, C++ : 8, Matlab : 7, Microsoft Office : 14, Simulink : 0, Machinery : 0, LabVIEW : 0, Ansys : 0, Microsoft PowerPoint : 0, Microsoft Word : 0, Microsoft Excel : 5, Public Speaking : 22, Customer Service : 7, Leadership : 11, Violin : 3, Calligraphy : 4, Hand Tools : 0, Community Service : 0, Power Tools : 0, Milling : 0, ""","",2,,"Mechanical Or Industrial Engineering",4,"Chirag Raote, Mihir Naik","Chirag Raote","Mihir Naik","GE Power; ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers); Satya Nadella; Boston Scientific; NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration; MIT Lincoln Laboratory"
