I majored in Business Analytics and Informational Technology, and pursued a concentration in Global Business. I aim to work in analytical positions, focusing on business operations and development.   As a part of the Honors College at Rutgers, I am a driven and hardworking individual. During my last year of undergrad, I am completing research about times series analysis of unemployment.  Coming to involvement, I served as Secretary for the Rutgers University chapter of Amnesty International.  I helped cofound the Rutgers chapter my sophomore year in order to get the Rutgers campus more involved with the fight for human rights all around the world.  This position has helped me build strong leadership, interpersonal, and communication skills.  I have a strong interest in global business, which has lead me to pursue a concentration in Global Business. I also had an incredible experience the summer after my sophomore year when I interned in Barcelona, Spain, which helped show me how businesses and companies run in a different part of the world.  I am a hardworking, personable, and attentive student. I put my all into any project I do and I am not afraid to ask questions. I work well in groups, as well as by myself. I take direction well, but also can lead others and myself to a valuable end result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazon","Incoming Business Analyst","Nov 2019","PRESENT","","Seattle, Washington","https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon","amazon",,,"Amazon","Business Analyst Intern","Jun 2019","Aug 2019","Amazon Web Services","Seattle, Washington","https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon","amazon",,,"Rutgers Writing Program","Writing Tutor","Feb 2018","May 2019","As a writing tutor at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, I help college-age students improve their writing skills, working specifically on analysis, structure, grammar, and techniques.","Rutgers University - New Brunswick (Livingston Campus)","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Rutgers%20Writing%20Program",,,,"Zoho Corporation","Data Analytics Intern","Jan 2019","less than a year","During this 3 week internship, I was tasked with analyzing Zoho's Partner Program.
