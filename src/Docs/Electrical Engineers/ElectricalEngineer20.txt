Overcame the shortcomings of identifying critical generators through heatmaps in an unstable power system, by using hypotheses CNN pooling which gives best outcome in case of multiple output model, resulting in over 91% accuracy. Executed a new approach for transient stability assessment, an upgrade over my previous work, using ConvLSTM neural network, resulting in highest accuracy of detection (98%) up to date. see less","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-george-washington-university---school-of-engineering-&-applied-science","the-george-washington-university---school-of-engineering-&-applied-science",,,"Gelman Library (The George Washington University)","Graduate Student Assistant","Sep 2017","Jun 2018","","Washington D.C.
