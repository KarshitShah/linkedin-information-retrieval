I have enhanced my skills through internship and co-op opportunities. I have exposure to different industrial setup like start-up, Automotive and Manufacturing Industries.  I have constantly kept myself involved in various engineering projects, engineering clubs etc to gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience. I am also learning various analysis tools like nastran and hypermesh to enhance my skills in machine analysis, but 'the road to gaining knowledge is never ending', as a true believer of this saying i am seeking Summer Internship to enhance my knowledge and provide efficient work in return.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Applied Materials","Mechanical Engineer I","Nov 2019","PRESENT","","Sunnyvale, California","https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-materials","applied-materials",,,"Southco, Inc.","New Product Development Engineering Co-op","Aug 2018","Dec 2018","• Designed and manufactured assembly fixtures and go/no-go gauges to aid manufacturing using Siemens NX which reduced technician cycle time by 30%.
