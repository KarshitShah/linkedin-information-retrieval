My interest areas are Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Operating Systems, Algorithms, and Software Development.   I did my software development summer intern in the Photoshop team of Adobe in New York. Prior to my graduate studies, I worked full-time for 3 years as senior member of technical staff in Adobe, India. Before that, I worked as a software engineer in the media management layer(MML) team in SanDisk Inc, Bangalore in India. I love to solve complex problems and very passionate about coding.  I completed my under-graduation in computer science engineering from Delhi Technological University(formerly Delhi College of Engineering) in 2014. During my time as an undergraduate student, I did my software industrial training in Java for 1 year from Ducat in Noida, India.    Apart from work, I like competitive programming, playing and watching cricket, listening to songs, watching movies, and taking part in volunteering and mentorship activities.

The problem was to load some 32-bit legacy DLLs in our 64-bit product. We build a wrapper 32-bit executable which loads 32-bit legacy DLLs and we were calling this executable from our 64-bit executable and handled communication via pipes. Prevented loading of this 32-bit executable every time by running this process in the background as a server to improve the performance.  * Implemented MRU list to display the recent files opened by the user on the starter screen of our product. It involves the C++ interface interacting with the JS code of our starter screen. Also, I have added the feature of favorites files where the user can mark a file as favorite and that file would store in favorites list which is maintained even after re-launch of the product.  * Designed and implemented a mechanism to render the starter screen of our product in a windows tab which can be docked and undocked as and when required. Moreover, I have added functionality to make this feature work on high-resolution monitors as well.  * Implemented DUDEN dictionary to support the latest spell checking and hyphenation methods for the German language (German, Swiss-German, and Austrian German).  * Fixed the Cadence Issue by writing the formatting rules inline in the generated XML file so that they will be able to post-process the XML file according to their requirements. see less","Noida Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/adobe","adobe",,,"Adobe","Member Of Technical Staff","Oct 2015","Jun 2016","Team: Adobe FrameMaker team  * Implemented an FDK client of document health report which reports unresolved graphic insets, text insets, cross-reference links in a document.  * Fixed many bugs in a rigorous environment for the patch releases of our product. see less","Noida Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/adobe","adobe",,,"SanDiskÂ®","Software Engineer","Jul 2014","Sep 2015","My key responsibilities were to implement the algorithms in Media Management Layer (MML) to efficiently store and retrieve the data from NAND memory.
