During my master's study, I got the exposure to various manufacturing disciplines but the ones which caught my interest are Lean Manufacturing, Continuous Improvement, and Product design.  During my undergraduate study in Mechanical Engineering, I was introduced to Manufacturing terminologies. After doing research about them, I was interested to know more about it.  Ever since, my long-term goal has been to gain enough experience to start my own manufacturing firm. I realized that expanding my knowledge in the manufacturing domain would prove to be a stepping stone to achieve my goal.   During my graduate study, I got the opportunity to work at Volvo Group Trucks Operation as an Axles Manufacturing Engineer Intern in Hagerstown, Maryland. This internship gave me the chance to learn how we can overcome manufacturing line challenges and increase the efficiency by using lean manufacturing and continuous improvement tools. Apart from that, an interesting and challenging experience during the course of my internship was the exposure to Autodesk Inventor, a CAD modeling software and Avix, a time study software.  I feel that this internship gave me just a glimpse of the manufacturing environment but there is still a lot more to explore in this field. I will be graduating in December-2019 and would be looking for opportunities in Lean Manufacturing, Continuous Improvement, and Product design areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Volvo Group Trucks Operations","Axles Manufacturing Engineer Intern","Jan 2019","May 2019","• Designed new tools in Autodesk Inventor focusing on operator’s safety and ease of use • Implemented 5S on Axle line and eliminated 15% waste and optimized efficiency • Calculated and documented “benefit to cost” ratio for improvements on bottleneck station • Used time study software Avix to analyze actual time of process with standard time • Performed Spaghetti analysis to find operators’ steps in a particular process or task • Conducted Man Machine Study for Yamazumi chart to carry out line balancing • Participated in kaizen events which resulted in saving $50,000 by focusing on cycle time reduction, safety, and Continuous improvement","Hagerstown, Maryland","https://www.linkedin.com/company/volvo-group-trucks-operations","volvo-group-trucks-operations",,,"Rochester Institute of Technology","Graduate Teaching Assistant","Aug 2017","Dec 2018","• Assisted more than 60 students to get hands on experience for test methods of Non-metals (Polymers, Rubbers) as per ASTM standards. • Drafted and graded assignments, demonstrated different experiments, as well as conducted doubt clearing sessions","United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/rochester-institute-of-technology","rochester-institute-of-technology",,,"Rochester Institute of Technology/National Technical Institute for the Deaf","Operations Assistant","May 2018","Aug 2018","• Administrate OnGuard/Lenel database to grant card swipe and key access to college offices and classrooms for approximately 15,000 faculty, staff and students. • Communicate clearly and work independently in a changing environment to ensure university compliance in ambiguous and at times stressful situations • Exercise responsibility and integrity while handling confidential materials see less","Rochester, New York Area","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Rochester%20Institute%20of%20Technology%2FNational%20Technical%20Institute%20for%20the%20Deaf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rochester Institute of Technology","Master of Science - MS","Manufacturing & Mechanical Systems Integration","3.61","2017","2019","","INDUS UNIVERSITY","Bachelor of Technology - BTech","Mechanical Engineering","","2013","2016","","Gujarat Technological University","Diploma","Mechanical Engineering","","2010","2016","","""Project Management : 4, AutoCAD Mechanical : 1, Creo : 1, 5S : 1, Lean Manufacturing : 0, Continuous Improvement : 0, Kaizen : 0, Manufacturing Engineering : 0, Data Analysis : 0, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) : 0, Six Sigma : 0, Product Development : 0, Value Stream Mapping : 0, Design for Manufacturing : 0, System engineering : 0, Kanban : 0, Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) : 0, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) : 0, Minitab : 3, Autodesk Inventor : 0, AutoCAD : 0, SolidWorks : 0, Time Study : 0, 5 Why : 0, Gage R&R : 0, Pugh matrix : 0, 8D Problem Solving : 0, ""","656",2,,"Mechanical Or Industrial Engineering",6,"Ishaan Thakker, vamshi krishna(andy)","Ishaan Thakker","Vamshi Krishna","Massachusetts Institute of Technology; PepsiCo; Sachin Tendulkar; Amazon; Google; Narendra Modi"
