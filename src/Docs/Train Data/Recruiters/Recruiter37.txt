For the last 8 years, I have engaged and cultivated talent communities, using creative storytelling to attract the best and the brightest. I enjoy having digital and in-person conversations, engaging with and discovering the best talent to come work for Facebook-- both via traditional ""old-school""​ methods as well as through hot new innovative digital & social platforms.   I enjoy utilizing recruitment as both an opportunity to develop a strong online brand presence as well as a chance to create talent engagement and community building of smart professionals. I'm first and foremost a candidate advocate, but also perform duties as a recruiting gate-keeper, process manager, career coach and an un-official psychologist, with strength in building meaningful, long lasting and relevant relationships.   What I'm really passionate about (come talk to me!): ♦ Employer Branding ♦ Recruitment Marketing ♦ Social Recruiting ♦ Employee Engagement   ========== ✔ Follow me on Twitter! 🐦🗣--​> @MaasaWalker <​--   ✨#FacebookLife✨",MaasaWalker,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://careers.microsoft.com/,http://blogs.microsoft.com/jobs/,,Facebook,"Recruiter - R4R leadership, Recruiting Programs & Ops",Aug-19,PRESENT,"✅ Currently leading leadership (manager) hiring for Facebook East (NY, DC and Boston) & Seattle. ✅ Leading all University Recruiting ICs and Manager/Leadership hires. ✅ Also leading Recruiting Programs & Ops hiring - Attract (Employer brand, Events, Creative), Engage (Intelligence, Resume reviewers & referrals), Experience (candidate experience, coordination), L&D (onboarding, development, instructional design), Insights (analytics), D&I.
