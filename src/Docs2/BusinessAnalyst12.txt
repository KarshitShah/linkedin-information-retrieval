Resilience. Adaptable I firmly believe in the congruent interplay of the above three traits. In a way to incorporate resilience through adaptability and flexibility.  Brought up in a family of business, I developed a strong inclination towards challenges. The ability to solve any problem and formulate a viable solution intrigued me. I knew I wanted to develop my career solving business problems using technology.  During my undergraduate education, I always looked for pragmatic applications of my theoretical knowledge and of my analytical aptitude. My internship at Johnson & Johnson significantly honed my perspective and bolstered my ‘problem-solving’ aptitude. Additionally, working on various projects across multiple domains significantly enhanced my learning curve. However, I saw a wide spectrum of knowledge I have not discovered. After completing my undergraduate studies, I started my M.S. Program at the University of Maryland. And this experience continues to be enriching across multiple levels.   The socially and culturally diverse atmosphere of India strengthened my collaborative attitude and interpersonal skills. As a passionate travel lover, I have and continue to interact with culturally diverse minds which has helped me further broaden my perspective and instilled a global outlook.  I graduate from University of Maryland in December 2018. I aim to construct a successful career in Business Data Analytics. I hold a clarity of my short-term and long-term goals and aim to accomplish them with hard work, congruity of character and passion.   I believe that every opportunity and individual has something I can learn from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ZS","Business Technology Analyst","Mar 2019","PRESENT","","Princeton, New Jersey","https://www.linkedin.com/company/zs-associates","zs-associates",,,"OCC","Data Science Intern","Jun 2018","Aug 2018","• Built a Stress Testing platform for cloud-based financial risk analytics that reduces execution time by 85% • Applied quantitative machine learning models on data residing on AWS servers to forecast Net Asset Values • Simulated Net Asset Values on a multi-billion row dataset of Options portfolios for 3 strategic market scenarios • Designed a dashboard for interactive real-time data analytics and presented to C-Suite executives see less","Greater Chicago Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/occ","occ",,,"Vencore Labs","Data Analytics and Management Intern","Jul 2015","Aug 2015","• Extracted data from 9 phone sensors using R infused Android Studio to study patterns in user behavior • Implemented machine learning models to identify significant user features to automatically unlock smartphones • Visualized sensor and unlocking data to make reports in Tableau and Excel and presented to senior executives see less","United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-communication-sciences","applied-communication-sciences",,,"Johnson & Johnson","Strategic Analytics Intern","Nov 2014","Mar 2015","• Studied trends in voter behavior from a population dataset and formulated strategies for a city-wide campaign • Coordinated campaign operations that increased youth voter registration in Mumbai from 49% to 67%","Mumbai","https://www.linkedin.com/company/johnson-&-johnson","johnson-&-johnson",,,"DDB Mudra Group","Strategy Intern","Mar 2014","Nov 2014","• Studied market trends and created consumer personas to identify key factors leading to sales of skincare products • Formulated strategies to associate Clean & Clear products with young customers to increase brand awareness • Engaged with our Fortune 500 client, Johnson & Johnson on a regular basis to understand business needs and support client requirements • Awarded ‘Best Campaign Design’ for clutter-breaking strategies that I presented to top J&J management see less","Mumbai Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/mudra-communications","mudra-communications",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Maryland","Master of Science - MS","Information Systems","","2017","2018","","Thadomal Shahani Engineering College","Bachelor of Engineering - BE","Computer Science","","2013","2017","",,,,,,,,"""Data Analysis : 9, Data Visualization : 7, Predictive Analytics : 7, Machine Learning : 8, Project Management : 6, Risk Management : 4, Data Mining : 4, Data Warehousing : 2, Data Management : 3, Cloud Computing : 2, Project Planning : 3, Project Estimation : 3, Business Analysis : 3, Identity & Access Management (IAM) : 2, Strategy : 0, Research : 0, Requirements Gathering : 0, Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) : 1, Database Design : 0, Business Intelligence : 0, Change Management : 0, Microsoft Excel : 7, C : 7, Java : 4, Python : 6, Tableau : 5, HTML : 6, Microsoft Office : 6, SQL : 4, R : 5, Microsoft SQL Server : 4, Google Analytics : 2, Google Adwords : 2, Microsoft Project : 2, Microsoft Word : 0, JavaScript : 0, Microsoft PowerPoint : 0, C++ : 0, Management Information Systems (MIS) : 0, MySQL : 0, Interpersonal Communication : 7, Management : 0, Leadership : 0, Public Speaking : 0, Teamwork : 1, Android Studio : 3, Graphics Processing Unit : 1, MapD : 3, Predictive Modeling : 3, Computer Information Systems : 0, ""","701",2,,"Information Technology & Services",9,"Rohit Keswani, Siddharth Nayak","Rohit Keswani","Siddharth Nayak","Satya Nadella; University of Maryland; OCC; Justin Trudeau; TSECites in USA; ZS"
