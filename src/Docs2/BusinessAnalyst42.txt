At Coder Kids we provide a coding and technology education for children as young as 5 years old so they can develop a passion for technology in childhood. We combine our tutor-guided, self-paced curriculum with coding leagues to create an unparalleled coding experience for children. We take pride in our more than 100 cutting edge courses that nurture and inspire beginner coders and stay abreast of changes in technology including artificial intelligence, robotics, data science, cryptography and more to challenge our children as they develop advance coding skills.  At Coder Kids we know the life-changing effects of education and we are strong advocates of encouraging girls to become engaged in STEM. In 2018, we mentored a team of girls ages 10-14 who became US national champions in Google's global Technovation Challenge. Understanding the vital importance of role models and mentors, half of our Coder Kids tutors are women.  Our mission at Coder Kids is to create and drive an innovative, nurturing and data-driven environment for Coder Kids to learn strategies for analyzing, designing, and collaborating â€” essential skills for the 21st century.
