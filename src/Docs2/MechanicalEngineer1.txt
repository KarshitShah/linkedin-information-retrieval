I recently graduated from Columbia University. I worked as a Research Assistant at The Creative Machines Lab where my study focused on soft Robotic actuators.   I secured a Bachelors degree in manufacturing where my study focused majorly on Production and Operations Management, Total Quality Strategy, Welding and Fabrication, Mould Making and Forming Technology, Jig and Fixture Design, Press Tool Design, Manufacturing Processes, Engineering Design.  During My Undergraduate Engineering I worked as a Design Team Member for team Vaayushastra that participated at SAE Aero Design Competition. The team Secured a Bronze medal for Technical Presentation. Responsibilities included Designing the Aircraft, Modelling, Preparing Design Report, Material trade studies and handling, Presenting.  I have experience in the industry as an in-plant trainee at Godrej And Boyce PED where I worked at the Welding Planning Department. The responsibilities included Making PQR , WPQ as per ASME section IX Boiler and Pressure vessel Code. While at the industry I successfully completed a Project for optimizing the strength of Carbon steel welds when Subjected to Normalizing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Schlumberger","Mechanical Engineer","Jan 2020","PRESENT","","Houston, Texas Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/schlumberger","schlumberger",,,"Columbia University in the City of New York","Course Assistant - Control Theory","Sep 2019","Dec 2019","Modern Control Theory","Greater New York City Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-university","columbia-university",,,"Landsdowne Labs","R&D Intern","May 2019","Aug 2019","","Fairfield, Connecticut","https://www.linkedin.com/company/landsdowne-labs","landsdowne-labs",,,"Columbia University in the City of New York","Course Assistant - Digital Manufacturing","Jan 2019","May 2019","Food Printing, Parametric Design","New York, New York","https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-university","columbia-university",,,"Columbia University in the City of New York","Research Assistant","Aug 2018","May 2019","Soft Robotics, Evolutionary Computation and Design Automation","The Creative Machines Lab","https://www.linkedin.com/company/columbia-university","columbia-university",,,"Godrej & Boyce Mfg.
