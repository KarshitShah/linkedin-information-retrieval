To create functional, reliable, human-centered products by applying mechanical engineering first principles. To solve complex problems with elegant solutions. To work with amazing engineers in cross-functional teams.  I am passionate about product design and development. I love the iterative design process right from sketching concepts - feasibility studies - FMEA - prototyping and manufacturing. I learnt a lot on the job and continue to learn through reading, thought problem-solving and situation analysis.   I graduated from Purdue with my Masters in Mechanical Engineering Management. By morning I was in business class debating corporate strategy, competing in marketing strategy, and by afternoon I was doing hard core mechanical engineering designing a heat pump system, or systems for an autonomous bot, or designing a novel product prototype. This degree gave me the unique skill-set to be a detail-oriented engineer while addressing the bigger business challenges. I took project-oriented courses to get a hands-on approach to problem solving and critical thinking. I took private pilot training at Purdue along with my Master's and earned my endorsement to fly solo without restrictions.   I most recently worked at Halliburton. I learnt industry-specific skills on the job. I was a key interface between my group (technology) and operations, manufacturing, and external vendor right from Day 1. For that, I needed top-notch communication, interpersonal skills combined with my technical understanding and adaptability to learn quickly in a new industry.   Some of the skills I've developed and use are -  * Six Sigma Thinking - FMEA, 5 Why's, Fishbone Analysis, Cause Effect Analysis * Root cause analysis and testing - oil analysis - SEM, EDS * Designing test fixtures and parts * Designing and executing test plans * Environmental testing - high pressure, high temperature, flow, vibration * Manufacturing processes - material selection, quality control, surface finishes * Industrial fastening and assembly methods * SolidWorks - always learning * GD&T - ASME Y-14.5 standards  I want to help companies build excellent, human centered products and solve complex challenges. I'm always curious, learning, and keeping abreast of latest technological advancements. If you're looking for a problem-solver and an excellent team player, I would love to have a conversation.
