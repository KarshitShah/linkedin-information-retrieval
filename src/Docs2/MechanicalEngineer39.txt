The idea was to design a device that would deliver a collagen gel (Developed by Dr. Bonassar at Cornell University) to repair intervertebral disc defect generated as a result of herniation of the disc. This project was a Collaboration with Dr. Hartl at Weill Cornell Medicine. Key Points: 1. Following Stanford’s Biodesign Process for Project Management 2. Utilizing Fusion 360 to develop a CAD model for designing the subcomponents of the device. 3. Leveraging Ultimaker 3D Printer to print the CAD models for prototype building. 4. Used Microsoft Office, Google Drive, and Basecamp for Document Management. 5. Divided the team based on the technical strengths of the members and conducted weekly group meetings to discuss the progress. 6. Biweekly brainstorm sessions to brawl the hurdles. 7. Preparing presentations and video clips for marketing pitches. see less","Greater New York City Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/weillcornellmedicine","weillcornellmedicine",,,"Cornell University","Graduate Teaching Assistant, Electrical and Chemical Physiology","Jan 2018","May 2018","Teaching Assistant for Electrical and Chemical Physiology  At Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, I assisted Professor Doerschuk for a Graduate level class in Electrical Engineering Major.

Objectives: 1. The main objective was to observe surgeries and discuss the hurdles during the surgery for coming up with engineering solutions to address the same. 2. Dr. Fanelli taught me how to multitask and still give a 100% to each of those tasks. 3. I was fortunate to learn time management from him. This role taught me a lot of interpersonal skills and it gave me more than my contribution. see less","Sayre PA","https://www.linkedin.com/company/robert-packer-hospital","robert-packer-hospital",,,"Maquet Getinge Group","Trainee","Dec 2015","Jan 2016","Inplant Internship  Being a trainee, the focus was on exposure to medical devices especially Critical Care units used in Operation theatres and ICU such as IABP(Intra Aortic Balloon Pump), Ventilators, Anaesthesia machine(Maquet flow-i), Heart-lung Machine(Maquet HL20) as well as other accessories such as OT-Lights (Volista) and OT-tables. Highlights: 1. Training equipped me with operational skills for these instruments, troubleshooting, safety features, emergency protocol, as well as technical purpose. 2. Developed a deep understanding of human anatomy and physiology with respect to the instruments and based it on the patient's health condition. 3. We were also given a brief idea about the medical device industry, hospital management, OT and ICU planning, and Gas management systems. 4. Additionally, it provided me an insight into the Marketing, Sales, Logistics and Supply Chain and Finances with respect to the medical device industry.","Mumbai Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/maquet-getinge-group","maquet-getinge-group",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cornell University","Master of Engineering - MEng","Biomedical/Medical Engineering","3.72/4.00","2017","2018","Class of 2018","University of Mumbai","Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)","Biomedical/Medical Engineering","3.68/4","2013","2017","Undergraduate Program at Dwarkadas J.
