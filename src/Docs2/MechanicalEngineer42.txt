The measurement involved two steps: experimental and Finite Element Analysis. Experiment involved measuring the natural frequency of vibration of the rod using MATLAB. FEA (vibrational and thermal) was used to estimate elastic modulus for the corresponding frequency and to analyze the temperature distribution along the sample. Discovered that zirconia when held in stage 3 of flash causes significant softening and very high damping in 3Y-TZP. see less","Boulder, Colorado","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cuboulder","cuboulder",,,"University of Colorado Boulder","Summer Research Assistant","May 2017","Aug 2017","Started working on the method ""flash sintering"" to sinter ceramics in Professor Rishi Raj's lab at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Performed flash sintering on several materials like 3YSZ, 8YSZ, ZnS, Calcia-doped zirconia. In-situ relative density (shrinkage) measurements were performed by video (frame by frame) along with data analysis to calculate the power density consumption during flash. • Worked with a post doc on developing optimal process conditions to sinter different types of ceramics • Conducted field-assisted (flash) sintering experiments in different atmospheres • Analyzed the SEM microstructures of specimens and phase changes using XRD & identified the effect of particle size • Evaluated the data collected to measure the conductivity and impedance of dense specimens see less","Boulder, Colorado","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cuboulder","cuboulder",,,"K J Somaiya College of Engineering Vidyanagar Campus Vidyavihar Mumbai-400 077","Project Lead","Jun 2015","Apr 2016","Led for an industry-sponsored project to design and build a semi-automatic stainless steel utensil polishing assembly. The challenge was to devise an assembly for a primitive lathe which could be disassembled when needed. After a series of design critiques, we successfully devised a lucid, reliable assembly. The cost of manufacturing was less than $150.","Mumbai Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/k-j-somaiya-college-of-engineering-vidyanagar-campus-vidyavihar-mumbai-400-077","k-j-somaiya-college-of-engineering-vidyanagar-campus-vidyavihar-mumbai-400-077",,,"K J Somaiya College of Engineering Vidyanagar Campus Vidyavihar Mumbai-400 077","System Engineer","Aug 2014","Mar 2015","As a systems engineer for team KJSCE Robocon, I administered a project to design and build two badminton playing robots.

I was directly involved in the brainstorming sessions, designing but mainly building of robots. Theme of the competition this year included having two bots: one manually operated and the other an autonomous one. The manually operated bot's responsibility was to carry and place an autonomous bot in certain places. Once place, the autonomous bot had to perform specified tasks like swinging, climbing and crossing from one pole to another. The fabrication process involved: - Machining using lathe - Building and testing prototypes","Mumbai Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/k-j-somaiya-college-of-engineering-vidyanagar-campus-vidyavihar-mumbai-400-077","k-j-somaiya-college-of-engineering-vidyanagar-campus-vidyavihar-mumbai-400-077",,,"University of Colorado Boulder","Master of Science (MS)","Mechanical Engineering","3.725/4.0","2016","2018","Thesis topic: In-Situ Measurements of the Elastic Modulus of zirconiapolycrystals held in a state of Flash Induced by an Electric FieldRelevant Coursework: Engineering Failure of Materials Intro to FEMMechanical Behaviour of Materials Solid MechanicsMaterials Chemistry and StructuresMechanics of Composite MaterialsSpacecraft DesignMethods of Engineering Analysis","K J Somaiya College of Engineering Vidyanagar Campus Vidyavihar Mumbai-400 077","Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.)","Mechanical Engineering","","2012","2016","",,,,,,,,"""Microsoft Office : 14, SolidWorks : 14, AutoCAD : 13, Engineering : 8, Product Design : 7, Research : 7, Mechanical Engineering : 4, Manufacturing : 4, Project Management : 4, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) : 4, Research and Development (R&D) : 2, Scanning Electron Microscopy : 2, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) : 2, Sheet Metal : 1, Rapid Prototyping : 1, CATIA : 8, Matlab : 8, C : 6, C++ : 6, Mathematica : 6, Microsoft Excel : 3, LaTeX : 3, MATLAB : 2, Management : 7, Team Management : 6, Sintering : 5, Experimental Research : 4, Ceramic Processing : 4, Additive Manufacturing : 3, Bill of Materials : 1, ""","426",2,,"Mechanical Or Industrial Engineering",4,"Ravi Srivastava, DEBASHIS DAS","Ravi Srivastava","Debashis Das","KLA; Randstad; Marla Gottschalk, Ph.D.; Jobs/Hiring Engineers, Mechanical, Automotive, Embedded hardware/Software, Design, Catia,Unigraphics; Edwards Vacuum; Richard Branson"
