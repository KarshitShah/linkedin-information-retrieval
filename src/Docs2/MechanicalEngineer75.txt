Enabling mission success through cost-effective solutions, and eager to contribute and deliver top KPIs by implementing lean manufacturing tools to all development phases required to bring components from concept to production.  I've always been a storyteller, long before I stumbled upon mechanical engineering. My approach to the work I create is simplistic yet thoughtfully detailed. I feel strongly about creating designs that are aesthetically pleasing, practical, and cost-effective solutions. I work to maximize operational efficiency and to reduce the cost of processes. Here is a link to my website where I regularly upload my latest designs: chausamir.myportfolio.com.  When not working on design projects, I love to spend my time outdoors, I am a certified SCUBA diver and adore diving deep into the peaceful underwater world. I’ve gained invaluable experiences and adaptability having lived and worked in India, Africa, Europe, and the United States meeting new people and learning about different cultures.
