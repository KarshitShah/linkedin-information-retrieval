I worked as a Data Science Intern at Ticketmaster for a year. My work involved calculating impact of their marketing campaigns on sale of its tickets by using Causal Impact, building a model to calculate the optimal market price of a seat, and calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer.  Previously, I was a Software Development Intern at Samsung R&D Institute which helped me contribute to Wireshark Open Source code by developing dissectors for 80 clusters of ZigBee Protocol.  I have always strived to excel at academics. Some of my notable achievements include being ranked 3rd amongst almost 200,000 students in MHT-CET, ranked 1st amongst boys and 4th overall in undergraduate college which also helped me earn the Dean’s Scholarship at USC. I was also awarded the CS merit award for the year 2018 at USC on account of my strong academic, research and industrial contributions.  I am very versatile when it comes to Computer Science with strong programming experience in Python, Java, SQL, C and C++. My stint as a Student Software Developer at Lee Research Group at USC enabled me to work on Web Technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. I have strong fundamentals in ML concepts and fascinated with Deep Learning and worked on predicting the future frames of a static image using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and bring it to life. Writing parts of Weenix kernel (UNIX based toy OS) in C helped me gain experience in Operating Systems.  Also, I have demonstrated strong communication, teamwork and leadership skills while leading a team of 6 to 2nd position during the Ticketmaster Intern Hackathon, being the Sponsorship Head at Pratibimb (VJTI’s annual cultural festival) and leading a group of 4 during the Final Year Project in VJTI.  I am passionate about building optimised software solutions with potential to impact millions of users and revolutionise the entire world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://github.com/sagar31594",,,"Google","Software Engineer","Jun 2018","PRESENT","• Part of the YouTube Video Ads Quality - Auction team at Google. • Improve and update the current video ads auction framework by optimizing for user experience and advertiser ROI.","San Francisco Bay Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/google","google",,,"Ticketmaster","Data Science Intern","May 2017","May 2018","• Part of the Fan Acquisition Data Science team at Ticketmaster. • Evaluated the impact of Ticketmaster's Search Engine Marketing campaigns for the events on its sales. • Used the concept of ‘CausalImpact’ in R which uses a Bayesian Structural Time Series model to evaluate the impact. • Analyzed 201 events, removed ‘additive outliers’ from the data and reported a gain of 44% in total orders. • Created an end to end Causal Impact implementation with automatic data fetching and preparation in Python and model execution in R to prioritize Ticketmaster’s marketing investment decisions. • Won 2nd prize at the Ticketmaster Intern Hackathon 2017. • Worked on evaluating the optimal market price of a seat using features related to demand information, artist popularity and venue geometry. • Calculated the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer by estimating the total number of future orders for that customer by using a Beta Geometric-Beta Binomial (BGBB) probabilistic model. see less","Hollywood","https://www.linkedin.com/company/ticketmaster","ticketmaster",,,"Norris Cancer Research Center, USC Health Science Campus","Student Software Developer","Sep 2016","May 2017","• Developed a website which helps the researchers to store and search results of DNA bio-sequencing from a centralized database with features such as upload results as a csv file and download as an excel file. • Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front end, PHP for back end, MySQL for database and PhpStorm IDE. • Developed a bioinformatics pipeline to be used as a web portal to enable users to analyze large FASTQ and FASTA files containing records of DNA sequences. see less","Los Angeles","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Norris%20Cancer%20Research%20Center%2C%20USC%20Health%20Science%20Campus",,,,"Samsung Research and Development Institute","Software Development Intern","May 2015","Jul 2015","• Worked for the Advanced Research Team on the project Messaging Protocol Test Framework Development. • Configured, studied and understood the Wireshark source code and its implementation as well as studied the ZigBee specification and its various profiles and clusters. • Implemented dissectors for about 80 clusters in ZigBee in C language using the Qt creator which have successfully become a part of the Wireshark Open Source code. see less","Bangalore","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Samsung%20Research%20and%20Development%20Institute",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Southern California","Master's degree","Computer Science","3.92/4","2016","2018","","Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI)","Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.)","Computer Science","9.35/10","2012","2016","Sponsorship Manager at VJTI Social Group - Pratibimb 2014Sponsorship Coordinator at VJTI Social Group - Pratibimb 2013Organized a coding event 'Code in X' at Technovanza 2013","T.
