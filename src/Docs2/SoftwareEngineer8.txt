I have a deep interest in Web, Cloud Computing, and applied Machine Learning. I have a strong programming background and experience in Machine Learning techniques, Object-oriented languages like C++, Java, and Python, AWS, Android development, and full stack Web technologies.   Apart from my varied full stack work experiences, I have a plethora of personal projects which attempts to bring the benefits of the generalization of Machine Learning to the end users via Web, Android, and pluggable libraries. This not only demonstrates my willingness to dive head-first into unexplored things and challenge myself but also my ability to quickly adapt to any technology and environment.

The module is an internal Web application authorized for admins, sales, and the business team which gives a thorough insight into the upcoming renewals for users, their segregations by insurers, types, days left to expire and other vital parameters. The application also provides teams to bulk export and import records, check for a possible renewal policy with a likelihood score computed using ElasticSearch for an expiring policy, and functionality to notify the status of the policy to the users and agents via email and SMS on-demand.  • Designed and developed SpringBoot Web application to consolidate each insurer's vehicle records into Turtlemint-Vehicle-Master (TVM) record. Used ElasticSearch to find out the best probable matches for each record to subsume into TVM using vehicle details as features. Automated the tedious manual process consuming few days to a mere few seconds process on the servers. Provided REST APIs with the roll-back feature to update the changes in the corresponding database collections, Elastic Search types and Aerospike cache sets on different environments from the dedicated server that housed consolidator application.  • Contributed to the development of MintPro (Android app) which enables the registered partners to log into their accounts and manage and assist their own customers.  • Trained business data team to use ""Turtlemint-Vehicle-Master Consolidator"" efficiently to carry out matching of records.  • Mentored newcomers on the projects I had sole ownership on - Turtlemint-Vehicle-Master Consolidator and Turtlemint Renewal Module. see less","Mumbai, Maharashtra, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/turtlemint","turtlemint",,,"Decimal Point Analytics","Machine Learning Software Developer","Sep 2015","Sep 2016","• Co-designed, developed and deployed Maven application for polling (using Apache Camel), identifying the file types, parsing and disintegrating CSV files from various FTP sources into the database to coagulate into a global master file. As a part of the pipeline, raw and converted files were synced to S3 bucket and backup server, maintaining two servers and S3 bucket in equilibrium. [ Read ""FTP File Management System"" in the Projects section for more information ]  • Sole owner and point of contact for the Web PlayFramework application for Admins to allow users to access their permitted directories on the server using Apache MINA. Along with an interface to manage users and their permitted directories, features like emailing the users about the changes in their permissions, account status, logging/activity tracking of users were implemented. [ Read ""Admin Dashboard"" in the Projects section for more information ]  • Developed Julia wrapper to Bloomberg API (written in C) via ccal by linking corresponding API DLL. Methods in API connecting to the Bloomberg server, fetches the queried data, ultimately passing to the wrapper's corresponding method via pointer referencing for processing, organizing and storing of data retrieved. Performed a stress test on the wrapper to ensure thread safety and optimal usage of the API limits through the wrapper.  • Trained and mentored newcomers (developers, DBAs, and the business team ) on the projects I had sole ownership on. see less","Mumbai Area, India","https://www.linkedin.com/company/decimal-point-analytics","decimal-point-analytics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"UC Irvine","Master's degree","Computer Science","","2018","2019","","VJTI, Matunga","Bachelor of Technology (BTech)","Computer Engineering","","2011","2015","Design head and event manager","Ramnarian Ruia College, Matunga","HSC","Electronics","","2009","2011","","""Data Structures : 23, Algorithms : 20, Machine Learning : 16, Android Development : 14, Artificial Intelligence : 12, Amazon Web Services (AWS) : 12, C : 15, Python : 11, MySQL : 11, Linux : 12, Spring Framework : 14, MongoDB : 11, Keras : 4, AngularJS : 4, JavaScript : 7, Google Cloud Platform : 5, Eclipse : 7, C++ : 27, Java : 21, ElasticSearch : 10, RESTful architecture : 12, ""","1742",2,,"Internet",23,"Shweta Singh, Aishwarya Jadhav","Shweta Singh","Aishwarya Jadhav","North Bombay Welfare Society (NBWS) High School Alumni; Satya Nadella; Haptic Technology & Tactile Design; Bill Gates; UCI MCS (Master of Computer Science); Intel Corporation"
